INTEX (Integrated Experience) is an intensive project within 
the Information Systems program, where we had a 5-day sprint 
to build a web application that informs the Provo community 
about social media's mental health impacts. We crafted a dynamic 
JavaScript front-end and a Node Express backend, supported by 
a PostgreSQL database on AWS RDS for robust data handling.

The application was deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and EC2, 
ensuring scalability and reliability. A live Tableau dashboard 
was integrated for interactive insights. Our toolkit included 
AWS technologies like EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline, and 
CodeCommit, streamlining development and enhancing collaboration.
